/* provisioning.h — public surface for the iot_cams WiFi provisioning
 * component.
 *
 * The component wraps ESP-IDF v5.5 `wifi_provisioning` (SoftAP scheme,
 * security 1 by default) and hides every IDF-specific include from
 * the rest of the firmware. Application code keeps three lines:
 *
 *     provisioning_init(&cfg, &info);   // once per boot
 *     if (!provisioning_is_provisioned()) provisioning_run();
 *
 * Internals — protocomm, mDNS, esp_wifi, the SoftAP HTTP server — are
 * not part of the public surface. If you find yourself wanting to
 * include them from app_main, you are reaching past the package.
 *
 * PERSISTENCE — the package does NOT carry a parallel NVS
 * namespace. The IDF `wifi_provisioning` manager writes the user-
 * submitted ssid + password to NVS via `esp_wifi_set_config()` /
 * esp_wifi's own NVS storage layer during the apply_config
 * flow. We rely on that built-in persistence for the credentials
 * the user cares about (so the device joins the same AP after a
 * reboot without re-provisioning). `provisioning_is_provisioned()`
 * reads back through `wifi_prov_mgr_is_provisioned()` against
 * the same storage.
 *
 * PoP and service_name are input to the provisioning session,
 * not output. They are Kconfig-fixed at build time (or supplied
 * per-boot via `provisioning_config_t`); runtime NVS persistence
 * is not required for either. `provisioning_reset_credentials()`
 * is the single reset path and routes through
 * `wifi_prov_mgr_reset_provisioning()`.
 *
 * THREADING — provisioning_init() must be called from app_main
 * (single thread) before provisioning_run(). provisioning_run()
 * blocks. provisioning_stop() may be called from any task to
 * trigger teardown; wifi_prov_mgr_stop_provisioning schedules the
 * stop on its own task and emits WIFI_PROV_END.
 *
 * LIFTING — to publish this component as its own upstream / repo
 * later, move the component directory, register the new URL via
 * the consumer's `idf_component.yml`, and replace the consumer's
 * `path:` dep with the URL. Nothing in this header changes.
